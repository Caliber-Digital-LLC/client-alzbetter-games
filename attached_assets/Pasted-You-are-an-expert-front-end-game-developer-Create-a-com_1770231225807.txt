You are an expert front-end game developer. Create a complete HTML5 slot machine game for a portrait-mode kiosk used in a VA nursing home. The game must feel like a fun Vegas slot machine, but calming, friendly, and NOT complex.

GOALS / TONE
- Audience: seniors; environment: VA nursing home.
- Vibe: calm, reassuring, warm; still “Vegas slot” fun (lights, gentle glow, satisfying wins).
- Simple: 3 reels x 3 rows, 5 symbols, single “SPIN” button, optional “AUTO” toggle, no complicated paylines UI.
- Big text, big buttons, high contrast, readable, accessible.

PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS
- Runs fully offline in a WebView on iOS + Android (no external CDN dependencies).
- Single-page app using plain HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks required).
- Responsive portrait-first layout, scales nicely from phone size to kiosk tablet size.
- Must handle mobile audio restrictions: sound starts only after a user gesture, then works thereafter.
- Avoid heavy animations that could cause motion sickness; keep transitions smooth and gentle.
- Respect reduced motion: if prefers-reduced-motion is enabled, reduce animations.

PROJECT OUTPUT
Create these files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- game.js
- assets/ (optional, but prefer generating assets in-code via SVG/Canvas and WebAudio so it’s offline)

GAME DESIGN SPEC
Layout (portrait):
- Top: Title (“Calm Vegas Slots”) and a small status line (“Tap Spin to play”).
- Center: Slot cabinet area with 3 reels visible as a 3x3 grid. Each reel spins vertically.
- Bottom: Big control area:
  - Primary: SPIN button (very large).
  - Secondary: AUTO (toggle) and MUTE (toggle).
  - A small “Credits” counter (start at 100), and “Bet” fixed at 1 (or allow a simple +/- with large buttons, capped 1–3).
- Feedback:
  - When spinning: disable controls except MUTE.
  - On win: show a gentle celebration (soft glow + confetti-like dots that float slowly), and play a short pleasant jingle.
  - On loss: subtle “Try again” message, no harsh sounds.

SYMBOLS / ASSETS (GENERATE THEM)
- Generate 5 symbols as inline SVG or canvas drawings (no external images):
  1) Star
  2) Heart
  3) Horseshoe
  4) Bell
  5) “7” (friendly rounded)
- Each symbol should have a consistent style: rounded shapes, soft gradients, and a calm palette (teal/blue/purple with gold accents).
- Sounds:
  - Generate sounds with WebAudio (no audio files):
    - spin start “whoosh” (soft noise + filter)
    - reel stop “tick” (very gentle)
    - win jingle (simple triad arpeggio, pleasant)
    - big win jingle (slightly longer, but still calm)
  - Provide a MUTE toggle that stops all sounds.
  - Provide a one-time “Tap to enable sound” gate on first interaction if needed (for iOS).

GAME LOGIC (SIMPLE)
- Use a deterministic RNG with window.crypto.getRandomValues for fairness.
- Reels:
  - Each reel has a symbol strip (array) and spins for a different duration (e.g., 900ms, 1200ms, 1500ms).
  - After spin, snap to final symbol positions so the 3x3 grid is crisp.
- Winning:
  - Evaluate only the middle row (single payline) for simplicity.
  - Payouts:
    - 3 of a kind: +10 credits
    - 2 of a kind (on middle row, first two or last two): +2 credits
    - Special: three “7”s = +25 credits (big win)
  - Deduct 1 credit per spin. If credits reach 0, show “Thanks for playing” and offer “Reset Credits” button.
- AUTO:
  - When enabled, auto-spin every ~2 seconds, but stop if credits low or user taps STOP.
  - Auto must be easy to disable.

UX / ACCESSIBILITY
- Buttons min 56px height, large hit targets, clear labels.
- ARIA labels for controls; an
